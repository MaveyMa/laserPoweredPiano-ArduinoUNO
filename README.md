### Arduino UNO Laser Piano
Physics of Computing Fall 2015 | Mario Martinez and Mavey ma
* Constructed a laser-powered piano where different notes can intuitively be played by obstructing the laser beam at
various marked distances
* Utilized ultrasonic sensor readings to determine distance to the user’s hand, which was then mapped to a note played
by the digital audio workstation
* Translated Arduino UNO’s serial signal into midi signal using converter application (Hairless), then fed signal to
digital audio workstation (FL Studio, with midi port emulator LoopBe1)
* Assembled electric circuit on breadboard with ultrasonic sensor, photoresistor, resistors, and LED
